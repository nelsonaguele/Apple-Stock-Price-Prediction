# Apple Stock Price Prediction Project
## Project Overview
##### This project aims to develop a machine learning models to predict future Apple stock prices based on historical data from 2014 to 2023. The repository contains all the necessary files, including data, Jupyter notebooks, and additional resources required to understand and run the project code.
## Contents
#### •	data/: Folder containing the dataset used in the predictions.
#### •	notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with all the code and analysis.
#### •	src/: Source code for custom Python modules used in the notebooks.
## Prerequisites
#### Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. You can install all dependencies with:
## Installation
#### Clone the repository to your local machine:
##### git clone https://github.com/nelsonaguele/Apple-Stock-Price-Prediction.git
##### cd Apple-Stock-Price-Prediction
## Running the Notebooks
#### Navigate to the notebooks/ directory and launch Jupyter Notebook:
##### Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially to see the analysis and results.
## Project Stages
#### •	Data Collection: Scripts and resources used to gather the data.
#### •	Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Methods applied to prepare the data for modeling.
#### •	Modeling: Development and tuning of the predictive model.
#### •	Evaluation: Metrics and techniques used to evaluate the model's performance.
